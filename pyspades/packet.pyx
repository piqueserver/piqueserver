def register_packet(loader=None, server=True, client=True, extension=None):
    """register a packet

    >>> @register_packet()
    ... class SomePacket(Loader):
    ...     pass

    Optionally can be used as function too, but this is discouraged unless you
    need to do this (the default pyspades loaders need this, as they are
    defined in C++ code):

    >>> class AnotherPacket(Loader):
    ...     pass
    ...
    >>> register_packet(AnotherPacket, server=False)

    Additionally you can specify if only the server or client can send this
    packet. This is only useful in a few rare cases, so these are set to
    ``True`` by default.

    Arguments:
        server (bool, optional): This packet can be sent by the server. True by
            default.
        client (bool, optional): This packet can be sent by the client. True by
            default
        extension (int, optional): The extension id this packet belongs to, if any

    Raises:
        KeyError: If the packet's ID has already been registered
    """

    # Rationale:
    # In the past, the packet list was static and contained no meta-information
    # about the packet this was fine, because there was really only one
    # version.  However, it is foreseeable from current developments that there
    # will be several played protocol versions and a number of clients could
    # have different feature sets that must be queried at runtime. Hence it is
    # useful to annotate packets with some kind of runtime information.

    # It is not known if full-blown multiple protocol version support will ever
    # be realized, but this is one step along the way. It might be a massive
    # miscalculation and be technical debt for the rest of the projects
    # lifetime, but only time will tell

        # Having to handle the two loader dicts seperate isn't very nice, but I
        # you can't avoid it whithout making things more complicated somewhere
        # else.
        # This is needed because certain packets (e.g. HitPacket and SetHP) in
        # likely a legendary case of premature optimisation (or because the
        # packet IDs had to be contigous in voxlap?) share packet IDs, but have
        # different meaning and format depending on who sends them
        # Since this library tries to work as both a Server and Client
        # implementation, both are always evaluated
