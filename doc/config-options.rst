.. TODO Document this on a separate page

Piqueserver ships with a set of scripts you can use to customize the features
of your server. They are loaded in order, "on top of" each other.

Scripts can either be absolute python import paths
(``piqueserver.scripts.aimbot2``) or the name of scripts in the scripts folder,
excluding the file extension (``mycustomscript`` for a script at
``scripts/mycustomscript.py``)::

    scripts = [
        "piqueserver.scripts.rollback",
        "piqueserver.scripts.protect",
        "myscript",
    ]

Logging
+++++++

Piqueserver can log events that happen to a text file::

    [logging]
    # set log level
    # log levels in decending order: debug, info, warn, error, critical
    loglevel = "info"
    # the logfile to log to
    # relative paths are resolved relative to the config directory; parent
    # directories are created as necessary
    # empty string disables logging
    logfile = "./logs/log.txt"

    # Write a new log file each day
    rotate_daily = true

    # enable the debug logging
    debug_log = false
    # enable profiling
    profile = false

ssh
+++

This section controls `SSH`_ "manhole" access to the server. This allows you
access to a python shell. This is maily useful for debugging. If you don't know
what you are doing, you should leave it disabled::

    [ssh]
    enabled = false
    port = 32887

    [ssh.users]
    # user = password
    # pairs for credentials allowed to login to the ssh server
    # WARNING: keep these credentials secure since this gives console access to the server
    # on which piqueserver is running!
    user1 = "ssh_pass_change_this"

.. _ssh: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell

status_server
+++++++++++++

The status server is a built-in web server that displays information about the
server and connected players::

    [status_server]
    enabled = true
    # the port to listen on
    port = 32886
    # write an access log

to the configuration directory. For example if the logfile is `./logs/log.txt`,
this will be in the `logs` subdirectory of the config directory.

balanced_teams
++++++++++++++

If 0, any permutation of teams is allowed. If 1 or greater, players are not
allowed to join a team if that would mean the difference in players count
between the two teams is more than the ``balanced_teams`` value. Default 2.

login_retries
+++++++++++++

The number of /login attempts allowed before users are auto-kicked. Default 3.

irc
+++

This section configures an IRC chatbot that reports server events in the given channel::

    [irc]
    enabled = false
    # IRC login details
    nickname = "piqueserver"
    username = "piqueserver"
    realname = "piqueserver"
    server = "irc.quakenet.org"
    port = 6667

    # channel to join into
    channel = "#piquserver-bots"
    # password for the channel
    password = ""

    # prefixes irc users must use for bot to process as command or to send to game chat
    commandprefix = "!"
    chatprefix = "."

set_god_build
+++++++++++++

Put the player into god build mode automatically when entering god mode

time_announcements
++++++++++++++++++

IP getting is disabled.

Note: this url must return solely the ip address in the response body.
