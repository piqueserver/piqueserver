Contributing (developer)
========================

This is the developer guide for contributing to piqueserver.

Requirements
------------

Any code which does not follow the requirements below have chances of
**not being accepted** into the ``master`` branch until modified to
comply with them. You may submit code which does not comply with the
requirements and leave for a maintainer to fix them, but it's considered
bad practice.

-  The `EOL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline>`__ (End-of-line)
   character for the file types below must be LF (\\n)

   -  Python and Cython scripts (``.py`` and ``.pyx``)
   -  C and C++ scripts (``.c``, ``.cpp``, ``.h``)
   -  Shell scrips (``.sh``, ``.bash``)

-  The `EOL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline>`__ (End-of-line)
   character for the file types below must be CRLF (\\r\\n)

   -  Windows scripts (``.bat``, ``.ps1``)

-  All files must end with their respective
   `EOL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline>`__ character, as
   mentioned above
-  Use `autopep8 <https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/>`_ to format python source files.
-  Use `clang-format <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html>`_ to format C/C++ source files. We have a custom ``.clang-format`` file at the root of the repository.


Testing
--------

Testing in piqueserver is performed with ``pytest`` with ``tox`` support.

Tox manages its own virtual environments, so if you have it installed on your
system, testing is as simple as running ``tox``, which will run all tests against
all supported python versions (skipping those not available on your system).


If you already are in your virtual env and wish to test something quickly,
``pytest`` directly may be useful:

.. code:: bash

   # make sure the venv is setup and all deps are installed
   python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate

   # build the cython extensions inplace
   # otherwise pytest has issues
   pip install -e .

   # and test away!
   pytest

   # single file
   pytest tests/piqueserver/test_server.py


Code Coverage
-------------

Code coverage is generated with `coverage.py <https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ using a ``pytest`` plugin.

.. code:: bash

   # generate coverage data
   pytest --cov=piqueserver --cov=pyspades

   # build the report file
   coverage html

   # view at htmlcov/index.html


Work-flow recommendations
-------------------------

* Get yourself comfortable with ``git`` from command-line, it allows
  you to do things that some GUIs can't
* Follow the below instructions for commit summaries (a.k.a. the first
  line)
* No more than 70 characters of length
* Describe an action, in imperative form
* **e.g.:** ``implement anti-cheating optimizations``
* See also: `Closing issues via commit
  messages <https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/>`__


Finding history
---------------

Although piqueserver code is based on PySnip and does contain its
commits, **it's not possible to see them by default** in the GitHub web interface or
`gitk <https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk>`_, due to `a
commit <https://github.com/piqueserver/piqueserver/commit/487515b235cbfcbb87bd774781128c2eea39d2a5>`__
in the early days of piqueserver that made the imported files be treated
as new ones.

To see the true history of a file, you must use an log visualizer that
follows renames, such as:

* ``gitk --follow *FILE*``
* ``git log --follow --pretty=oneline *OPTIONS*``
