Installation from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: 

    Most of the piqueserver team uses Linux and we aren't experienced with Cython on windows. 
    If you can help us improve windows support we'd greatly appreciate it.

Tricky bit for windows is to get Cython working.

* Install Visual C++ compiler please follow `this guide <https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers>`_.
* Don't forget to upgrade `setuptools`
* Install git or download sources from github and unzip
* If you decided to use git: `git clone https://github.com/piqueserver/piqueserver`

.. tip:: If you see errors like "unable to find vcvarsall.bat" refer to `this article <https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/pythonengineering/2016/04/11/unable-to-find-vcvarsall-bat/>`_.

.. code:: bash

    cd piqueserver
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    pip install .
